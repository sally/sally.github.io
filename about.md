The Jekyll Now theme came with this about page, where I suppose I'm to include some information about myself.

### Stuff

My favorite colors are pink, mint, black, and white.

My favorite animals are owls, lions, and bears.

My favorite pok√©mon is Raichu.

I love Tarantino films, and my favorite is Inglourious Basterds.

Some of my favorite video games series include Legend of Zelda, Dark Souls, .hack, and Guilty Gear.

The most recent thing I finished playing is a VN-style bartender simulation game called [VA-11 HALL-A](http://store.steampowered.com/app/447530/).
